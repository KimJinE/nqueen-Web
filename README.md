# CISC481 Project 2 nqueen problem
I designed my project just like what professor shows on the class. First select the number of queen, then pick the column of each queen. I set Q1 in row1, Q2 in row 2 and so on. I use the react to write the code which is most popular language.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
if not work, run the npm i first.

### `link`

I use firebase to deploy the web
